# This configuration file binds many vi- and vim-like bindings to the
# appropriate tmux key bindings.  Note that for many key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue.  This is intended for tmux 1.3, which handles pane selection
# differently from the previous versions

# split windows like vim
# vim's definition of a horizontal/vertical split is reversed from tmux's
bind s split-window -v -c '#{pane_current_path}'
bind v split-window -h -c '#{pane_current_path}'
bind c new-window -c '#{pane_current_path}'

# move around panes with hjkl, as one would in vim after pressing ctrl-w
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

# resize panes like vim
# feel free to change the "1" to however many lines you want to resize by, only
# one at a time can be slow
bind < resize-pane -L 1
bind > resize-pane -R 1
bind - resize-pane -D 1
bind + resize-pane -U 1

# bind : to command-prompt like vim
# this is the default in tmux already
bind : command-prompt

# vi-style controls for copy mode
setw -g mode-keys vi

# Setup 'v' to begin selection as in Vim
bind-key -t vi-copy v begin-selection
bind-key -t vi-copy y copy-pipe "reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy"

set-option -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l bash"

bind-key H swap-window -t -1
bind-key L swap-window -t +1

# UTF-8
set-option -g status-utf8 on

# supposedly fixes pausing in vim
set-option -sg escape-time 1

set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

# Reload source file
bind-key r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display-message "Configuration reloaded"

bind-key S command-prompt "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"
